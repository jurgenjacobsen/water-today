# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: March 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how your data is handled by the **Water Today** Chrome Extension (the "Extension"). 

## 1. Our Privacy Philosophy
We believe that productivity tools should respect user privacy. **Water Today is designed to be a private, local-first tool.** ## 2. Data Collection
**Water Today does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**
* **No Personal Information:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or contact details.
* **No Tracking:** We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or cookies to monitor your browsing behavior.
* **No External Communication:** The Extension does not communicate with any external servers. All timing logic happens entirely within your local browser environment.

## 3. Data Storage
The Extension uses the `chrome.storage` API to function. 
* **Settings:** Any durations you set (e.g., changing a focus session from 25 to 50 minutes) are stored locally in your browser.
* **Deletion:** This data is automatically deleted if you uninstall the Extension. 

## 4. Permissions Disclosure
To provide its single-purpose functionality, the Extension requires the following permissions:
* `notifications`: Used solely to alert you when a focus or break interval has ended.
* `storage`: Used solely to remember your timer preferences between browser sessions.
* `alarms`: Used to ensure the timer continues to run accurately even when the extension popup is closed.
* `offscreen`: Used to play reminder sounds without needing an active popup, in compliance with Manifest V3 requirements.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing
Because we do not collect any data, we do not sell, trade, or share any information with third parties. There is no data to share.

## 6. Compliance
This policy is intended to comply with the **Chrome Web Store User Data Policy**, including the requirements for **Limited Use**.

## 7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy occasionally to reflect changes in the Extension's features. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.

## 8. Contact
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the Extension's privacy practices, please open an Issue on this GitHub repository.
